/**
 * A members-gated response must not carry the shop's identity in its HEAD.
 *
 * The gate screen itself was verified empty — no links, no catalogue, no policy
 * text — while the document around it still announced everything:
 *
 *     <title>Sign in · Big Flowers Co.</title>
 *     <meta name="description" content="Same-day cannabis delivery, paid at the door.">
 *     <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-title" content="YB">
 *     <link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">
 *
 * The title is the browser tab. It was the loudest leak on the page and the one
 * nobody looks at, because checks grep the body.
 *
 * So this is `generateMetadata`, not a static object: it reads the same header
 * the layout branches on and returns a document with no identity in it. The
 * manifest is handled separately in src/app/manifest.ts — a manifest link is
 * injected by file convention and its fetch does not carry cookies, so it
 * cannot be answered per-visitor.

/**
 * Is this response gated? Fail CLOSED on an unstamped request.

 * proxy has an exclusion list, and every path on it reached the layout looking
 * exactly like an allowed one. /robots.txt served the whole branded shop that
 * way. Absence of a decision is not a decision to let someone in.
 *
 * On an open storefront (MEMBERS_ONLY off) this is always false, so YB and

  // upstream flag. The store profile carries an `ageGate` boolean that a
  // dashboard toggle can flip; this storefront deliberately does not read it —
  // and `PublicStoreProfile` no longer even carries it, so there is nothing to
  // wire back by accident. The only thing configuration decides is the
  // THRESHOLD (`minAge`, defaulted to 21 both in the mapper and in the
  // fail-safe fallback profile).
  //
  // TWO LAYERS, and both are needed:
  //   1. `middleware.ts` rewrites every navigable URL to /age when the cookie is
  //      missing, so the catalog page function never runs and never reaches the
  //      RSC flight payload. That is the layer that actually holds — without it
  //      the whole shelf ships inside <script> tags under the gate.
  //   2. This branch renders the gate instead of `children`, so a request that
  //      somehow skipped middleware still shows no store.
  //
  // ONE EXCEPTION, and it is not a loophole: /privacy and /terms. CalOPPA
  // (B&P § 22575) requires the privacy policy to be conspicuously posted, and
  // the gate is itself a point of collection — it sets a cookie before anyone
  // has read anything — so hiding the policy behind it makes the link on the
  // gate lead back to the gate. Those two routes render no catalogue data at
  // all, so the thing layer 1 protects is not in play. The header is stamped by
  // `src/proxy.ts`, which deletes any inbound copy first.
  const reqHeaders = await headers();
  // Trust OPEN_ROUTE_HEADER only when the proxy stamped this request. The proxy
  // deletes inbound copies — but only on paths it runs on, so on an excluded
  // path a client could simply SEND `x-ybs-open-route: 1` and the layout

                  Four columns, as the client asked, and deliberately quiet:
                  brand, Shop, Info, Contact.

                  WHAT MOVED RATHER THAN VANISHED. The licensee block used to
                  sit here because B&P § 26151(a)(1) requires advertising to
                  identify the licensee by number, and every page of a store is
                  marketing. The client's own reference site carries it nowhere,
                  and asked for this footer simplified — so the licence, the
                  entity name and the local permit now live on /terms and
                  /privacy, which every page still links to. Discoverable, one
                  click away, and off the shop window. That is a judgement the
                  client made knowingly; it is recorded here so nobody later
                  assumes it was lost by accident.

                  ⚠️ STILL NO PROP 65 WARNING HERE, and there must not be one.
                  27 CCR § 25602(b)(1)(C): a warning is not prominently
                  displayed if "the purchaser must search for it in the general
                  content of the website". A footer warning earns nothing. It
